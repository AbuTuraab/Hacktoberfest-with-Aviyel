## Week 1 (October 1st - October 8th)

In this first week of the hacktoberfest:

1. To help you get started with the content creation journey, we have an amazing lineup of speakers who will share their insights on content creation. Hear from them and learn how they enhanced their skills, as well as what opportunities await you in the future!
2. Participants will then be asked to write content about general topics, and the deadline for that is one week (October 7th).
